                <p>
                I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Toronto experienced in full-stack development, expecting to graduate in Spring 2025.
                I'm interested in developing software systems and am passionate about using my technical expertise to solve a variety of the world's problems.
                I am proficient in <code>Python</code> and <code>JavaScript/TypeScript</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                I love to learn about new tools and technologies and am currently working on expanding my web development skills.
                In the past, I assisted with the development of <a className="info-link" href="https://github.com/pyta-uoft/pyta">PythonTA</a> and
                participated in several hackathons such as <a className="info-link" href="https://devpost.com/software/reddit-analysis">TreeHacks</a> and <a className="info-link" href="https://devpost.com/software/superlist">Hack The North</a>.
                I interned as a full stack developer at <a className="info-link" href="https://www.dashhudson.com/">Dash Hudson</a>. 
                I have recently completed a 16-month internship at HelloFresh, where I contributed to the development of React and React Native apps for the Ready-to-Eat brands, such as Factor and Youfoodz.
                </p>
                <p>
                I am always looking for learning oppourtunities and ways to develop my experiences as an aspiring software engineer. Feel free to connect! :)
